// This is the main application component for the Workout Tracker.
// It manages the state of workouts and renders the WorkoutForm and WorkoutList components.
// It also provides a button to clear all workouts with a confirmation prompt.
// The component uses React hooks to manage state and effects, and it styles the application using Tailwind CSS classes.
// The workouts are stored in a state variable, and the setWorkouts function is passed down to child components to allow them to update the list of workouts.
// The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing a simple interface for tracking workouts.
// The main features include adding new workouts, viewing a list of logged workouts, and clearing all workouts with confirmation.
// The component is structured to be modular, with separate components for the workout form and workout list, promoting reusability and maintainability.
// The use of Tailwind CSS allows for quick styling and responsive design, making the application visually appealing and easy to use.
// The application is built with React, leveraging its component-based architecture to create a clean and organized codebase.
// The WorkoutForm component handles the input for new workouts, while the WorkoutList component displays the logged workouts.
// The application is designed to be easily extendable, allowing for future features such as workout history, statistics, or user authentication.
// Overall, this component serves as the foundation for a workout tracking application, providing essential functionality for users to log and manage their workouts effectively
